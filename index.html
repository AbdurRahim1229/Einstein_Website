        <h2>About Einstein</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His famous equation, E = mc², demonstrated the relationship between mass and energy, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe. Born in Germany, Einstein became a Swiss and American citizen, and his groundbreaking contributions earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was an advocate for civil rights, a promoter of pacifism, and a lover of music, particularly playing the violin. His curiosity and passion for knowledge made him one of the most influential scientists of all time.</p>
